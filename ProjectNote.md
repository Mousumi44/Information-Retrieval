Transparent, Scrutable and Explainable User Models for Personalized Recommendation|https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3331184.3331211|In summary,we make the following contributions: (1)we present
an efficient method for inferring set-based user preferences from
ratings given to individual items based on the tags associated with
those items; (2) we develop a simple, effective, and computationally
efficient recommendation model that operates on item tags and
set-based user preferences; (3) we propose a simple algorithm for
generating natural language explanations of user preferences; (4)
we show the value of such a transparent and scrutable model.|https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset|
