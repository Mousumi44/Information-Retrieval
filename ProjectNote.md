Transparent, Scrutable and Explainable User Models for Personalized Recommendation|In summary,we make the following contributions: (1)we present an efficient method for inferring set-based user preferences from ratings given to individual items based on the tags associated with those items; (2) we develop a simple, effective, and computationally efficient recommendation model that operates on item tags and set-based user preferences; (3) we propose a simple algorithm for generating natura language explanations of user preferences; (4) we show the value of such a transparent and scrutable model.|[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3331184.3331211)|[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)|
A Capsule Network for Recommendation and Explaining What You Like and Dislike |<li> Reasoning a rating behavior by analyzing the logic unit of making a review help to understand it better</li> <li> propose a deep learning model for analyzing reasoning (claim first attempt) </li> <li> framework jointly identify informative logic units and estimate their effects in terms of sentiment analysis</li>| [Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3331184.3331216)| -------------|
