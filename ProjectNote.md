Transparent, Scrutable and Explainable User Models for Personalized Recommendation|<li> present an efficient method for inferring set-based user preferences from ratings given to individual items based on the tags associated with those items</li> <li> develop a simple, effective, and computationally efficient recommendation model that operates on item tags and set-based user preferences</li><li> we propose a simple algorithm for generating natura language explanations of user preferences </li><li> show the value of such a transparent and scrutable model</li>|[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3331184.3331211)|[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)|
A Capsule Network for Recommendation and Explaining What You Like and Dislike |<li> Reasoning a rating behavior by analyzing the logic unit of making a review help to understand it better</li> <li> propose a deep learning model for analyzing reasoning (claim first attempt) </li> <li> framework jointly identify informative logic units and estimate their effects in terms of sentiment analysis</li>| [Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3331184.3331216)| [yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)|
Adversarial Mahalanobis Distance-based Attentive Song Recommender for Automatic Playlist Continuation (APC)|<li>propose three deep learning approaches (MDR, MASS, and MASR) that fully exploit Mahalanobis distance to tackle the APC task.</li><li>improve the robustness of model by applying adversarial personalized ranking and customizing it with a flexible noise magnitude</li>|[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3331184.3331234)|..
